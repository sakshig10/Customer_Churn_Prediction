## Overview
This project focuses on predicting telecom customer churn using machine learning models. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers leave a service provider, can have a significant impact on a telecom company's profitability and customer satisfaction. By building predictive models, we aim to identify customers at risk of churning and take proactive measures to retain them.

## Problem Setting
Telecom companies face the challenge of retaining customers in a highly competitive market. Customer churn can lead to revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs. To address this challenge, we have collected and analyzed customer data, including billing information, service usage, and customer demographics.

## Problem Definition
The primary objective of this project is to develop accurate predictive models for telecom customer churn. We have considered several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Neural Networks, and KNN, to determine which one performs best in predicting churn. We've evaluated these models based on various performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
Here are the key results and findings of our project:
- Among the models tested, Random Forest and Logistic Regression outperformed others in terms of accuracy and F1-score.
- The analysis of feature correlations revealed that "Monthly Charges," "Paperless Billing," and "Payment Method" have the highest correlations with customer churn.
- The DNN (Deep Neural Network) model showed lower performance, possibly due to its complexity and potential overfitting.

## Impact of Project Outcome
The outcomes of this project have several practical implications for telecom companies:
- Improved Customer Retention: By accurately predicting customer churn, telecom companies can take proactive actions to retain customers, such as offering personalized promotions or marketing strategies or better customer support.
- Cost Reduction: Reducing customer churn can significantly lower the costs associated with acquiring new customers.
- Data-Driven Decision Making: The project emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making in telecom customer management.

This project serves as a practical example of using machine learning to address a real-world problem and showcases the impact of predictive analytics on customer retention and company profitability.
